# ENVITED Ecosystem Specifications (EVES)

The goal of the EVES project is to specify and provide high-quality documentation for developing, distributing and using standard-compliant co-simulation artifacts and data.
It is an initiative of the Automotive Solution Center for Simulation e.V. (ASCS) targeting the ecosystem around the [ENVITED-X Data Space](https://envited-x.net/).

The specifications itself are written as independent documents based on so-called "improvement protocols" typically used in de-centralized standardization efforts, e.g. in blockchain domains. These individual specification documents stand for themselves but can inherit from one another by reference.

All EVES documents are written in markdown format, sequentially numbered and stored in the [EVES folder](./EVES/).
The process on how to write, submit or change specifications in defined in [EVES-001](./EVES/drafts/EVES-001/eves-001.md).
